Q: Are average scores for hospital quality or procedural variability correlated with patient survey responses?

A: Since I based the measure of hospital quality on TPS I cannot check for correlation since I know each measure is not independent. 
(Patient surveys are used to generate the patient experience score that is 30% of the final TPS score). 
That said I can see if the procedural outcome (measured in the previous section) has any correlation with the final patient score. 

In the readmission and death table, hospitals are graded as being either better, the same, or worse than the national average across each of the eight major procedure areas. 
Knowing this, we can group hospital into sets based on their performance and see if there is any correlation with the final patient score received. 

*Note: I had difficulty getting my GROUP BY statements to work on my CASE statements. As a result I ended up materializing tables sequentially to get to my final query. 

First, I materialized a table to count the number of scores it received above the national average (max 8) and the number of score it received below the national average (max 8). 
Based on this table, next, I materialized a table subtracting the ‘number of scores above’ minus ‘number of scores below’, effectively grouping all my hospitals in scores from -8 (all below average) 
to 8 (all above average). Checking the number of hospitals in each grouping we note that we have a sufficient sample in the groupings from -3 to 4. 

-7      1                                                                       
-5	3
-4	16
-3	62
-2	133
-1	491
0	3647
1	269
2	106
3	30
4	20
5	3
6	3
8	1


Finally I averaged the patient scores for each hospital in each performance point category to see if there was any noticeable correlation. 

-3	33.14754098360656
-2	32.61290322580645
-1	34.80235294117647
0	44.69034517258629
1	40.13725490196079
2	40.633663366336634
3	39.86666666666667
4	47.85

It can be noted that hospitals with more rating below average than above average (-3 - -1)score below all hospitals scoring even or better (0 - 4). 
These below average hospitals tend to score around 10 points worse on patient scoring. These results indicate that this should be an area of additional research. 
Additional more rigorous statistical testing could validate the strength of this correlation and better visualization tools could convey the findings more clearly.
