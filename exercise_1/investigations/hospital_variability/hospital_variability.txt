Q: Which procedures have the greatest variability between hospitals?

A: Procedures are broadly defined in the original dataset containing medical procedures in addition to preventative care, and safety features. 
Moreover some of these metrics were binary or on based on time. I wanted to focus on medical procedures and the range of their outcomes. 
As a result I used readmission and death statistics to calculate the success rate of medical procedural intervention. 
The numbers in the data set represents the percent of patients readmitted for the same problem or who died from the original affliction within 30 days. 
These metrics best capture all the procedures required to address an issue such as anesthesia, surgical efficacy, and post-surgical care. 
High performing hospitals should have low numbers and procedures with large ranges indicate a variability in applied theory of care. 
Below are the top 10 procedures ranked by the largest range (as a percent) of witnessed readmission or death. 
Max and minimum rates are also shown as a percentage to show the current best and worst expected results with modern techniques. 

procedure_id	procedure										highest_rate	lowest_rate	range_of_rates
READM_30_HF     Heart failure (HF) 30-Day Readmission Rate      					31.7    	15.8    	15.900001
MORT_30_STK	Death rate for stroke patients								22.3		8.7		13.599999
MORT_30_PN	Pneumonia (PN) 30-Day Mortality Rate							20.3		6.9		13.4
MORT_30_HF	Heart failure (HF) 30-Day Mortality Rate						18.5		7.2		11.3
READM_30_COPD	Rate of unplanned readmission for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients	26.5		15.5		11.0
MORT_30_AMI	Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) 30-Day Mortality Rate					20.6		9.9		10.700001
MORT_30_COPD	Death rate for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients			13.8		4.8		9.0
READM_30_STK	Rate of unplanned readmission for stroke patients					17.5		8.7		8.8
READM_30_PN	Pneumonia (PN) 30-Day Readmission Rate							21.8		13.2		8.599999
READM_30_CABG	Rate of unplanned readmission for CABG							19.8		11.4		8.4

The resulting data shows that heart failure procedures show the greatest variability in effectiveness followed by stroke and then pneumonia care.
