Q: What states are models of high-quality care?

A: For the state level analysis I carried over the assumptions from the hospital analysis (looking exclusively at acute care hospitals offering emergency services & using TPS as the measure of quality care). 
My initial investigation looked at ranking states by average TPS score but frequently the top 10 state’s best hospital was lower than the best hospital in other states. 
While having consistently high scoring hospitals is a great achievement, it did not seem appropriate to call the state a “model” state when it didn’t have a top 10 hospital. 
Ultimately I defined a “model state” as a state that enables a hospital to achieve the highest possible score. 
Given that complex procedures are typically performed by high performing hospitals it is safe to assume that Medicare patients could travel in-state for receiving critical care, 
thus making the highest scoring hospital a good metric of analysis for states.  Below are the top 10 states that are models of high-quality care, ranked by the top TPS score within each state:

state	highest_quality_of_care		avg_quality_of_care	range_of_quality_of_care
MO      92.8    			44.16964224222544       73.5                                    
TX	90.47619			41.798281508885076	70.309525
AZ	86.8				38.49964531262716	65.44546
UT	85.0				43.74750580106463	59.785713
CA	84.5873				39.16481364759287	74.84286
OK	84.42857			45.84810958275428	63.060394
MN	84.30159			51.72486788431804	52.70159
TN	83.6				39.71264291944958	67.6
KS	82.82539			42.72153864408794	59.116302
AL	82.8				44.30938097635905	61.218185

With a top possible score of 100, these states host hospitals with extremely high scores. 
Additional columns were included to show the average TPS score in the state as well as the range of scores between the highest and lowest performing hospital. 
Given that average TPS scores are typically half or less than the max TPS score in-state, it shows the importance of being near the high scoring hospital in the state. 
MN, ranking 7th on my list but highest in average score and lowest on range, seems to have done the best distributing best practices across its hospitals. 
That said, I cannot in good faith rank MN number one overall because there are hospitals achieving scores over 8 points higher.
