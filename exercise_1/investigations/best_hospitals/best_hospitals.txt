Q: What hospitals are models of high-quality care? That is, which hospitals have the most consistently high scores for a variety of procedures.

A: The purpose of my analysis is to study the quality of care for Medicare patients. Looking at the hospitals in the database there are hospitals with and without emergency services. 
Additionally there are four hospital types:

hospital_type
Childrens                                                                       
Acute Care Hospitals
ACUTE CARE - VETERANS ADMINISTRATION
Critical Access Hospitals

Since Medicare patients are at least 65 years old or are on disability, I removed “Childrens” hospitals. 
I also removed “Veterans” hospitals because they only serve a portion of the Medicare patients and I want to have results  that can be applied to the largest population. 
Finally I removed “Critical Access Hospitals” (extremely small rural hospitals with 25 or fewer beds) because of the small portion of Medicare patients covered. 

Initial exploratory analysis uncovered that all hospitals in the database did not provide the same services. Specifically, rehabilitation and specialist centers were included. 
While they typically scored high I removed them from my analysis because they are not designed to handle all the needs of the existing Medicare population. 
For this reason I also excluded hospitals that did not offer emergency services. After data cleansing I was left with hospitals that were equipped to handle all the needs of a Medicare patient: acute care hospitals with emergency services.

“Quality of care” is a multi-faceted metric. Fortunately the  Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) have developed an initiative called the Hospital Value-Based Purchasing (HVBP) Program. 
Its primary goal is to reward acute-care hospitals with incentive payments for the quality of care they provide to Medicare beneficiaries.
Quality of care is assessed via the Total Performance Score (TPS) which is comprised of the Clinical Process of Care domain score (weighted as 20% of the TPS), 
the Patient Experience of Care domain score (weighted as 30% of the TPS), the Outcome domain score (weighted as 30% of the TPS), and the Efficiency domain score (weighted as 20% of the TPS). 
CMS believes these four factors best represent quality of care and thus I too will use TPS as principal metric of study.

Below are the top 10 quality of care hospitals, evaluated by their overall TPS, for Acute Care Hospitals offering emergency services:

id	hospital					state	quality_of_care_score
260227  BLACK RIVER COMMUNITY MEDICAL CENTER    	MO      92.8                    
450834	PHYSICIANS CENTRE,THE				TX	90.47619
030120	GILBERT HOSPITAL				AZ	86.8
460039	BEAR RIVER VALLEY HOSPITAL			UT	85.0
050234	SHARP CORONADO HOSPITAL AND HLTHCR CTR		CA	84.5873
370210	OKLAHOMA SURGICAL HOSPITAL, LLC			OK	84.42857
240141	FAIRVIEW NORTHLAND REGIONAL HOSPITAL		MN	84.30159
440032	WELLMONT HAWKINS COUNTY MEMORIAL HOSPITAL	TN	83.6
170109	MIAMI COUNTY MEDICAL CENTER			KS	82.82539
010045	FAYETTE MEDICAL CENTER				AL	82.8



While other hospitals in the total dataset have higher scores, they do not offer all services and thusl they should not be in the same analysis group. 
Future studies could be done to identify high quality specialized or rehabilitation hospitals for Medicare patients seeking unique and predefined procedures.
