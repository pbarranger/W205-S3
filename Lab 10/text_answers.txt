3. I would sepereate the storage of the information from the processing of the information. If the processing gets backed up, 
the data is still stored so that it can be processed at a later date. 

With a store then process model, if the processing was updated it could start working immediately on the existing unprocessed 
data store and then could be rerun over the stored data that had already been processed (time allowing) so that the entire record
is processed by the updated process. Depending on how far back the updated process wants to be applied it could be expensive to 
store and process all the previously processed data. This would need to be balanced based on business needs and cost efficacy.

  30 second batch: count for last batch
