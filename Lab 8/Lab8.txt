1. Missing in "State": 5640
Territories and DC included but the below did not have a logical pair. 

AA 10
AE 143
AP 110
(blank) 5377

2. Zip codes missing: 4362

That said, I have 39306 rows with less than 5 digits indicating a potential missing/incorrect value.

3. Zip codes missing: 34944

4. Changing to 3 gave me poor quality pairs (Indonesia and Micronesia, Tajikistan and Pakistan). I would stick with 3.  

5. California and Alaska 

6. My instance had difficulty doing the computation. 
The tool could have a pop-up telling you the number of unique strings and the relative time to perform the calculation as a warning. 

7.
